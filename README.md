# SDEV-220-Final-Project-Group-6
Our project consists of a chatbot that has a use case of customer service for a phone company. The bot is named Bell after the fictional phone company Bell Phone. The bot can be used to ask for technical questions like what to do about login failure to asking about the phone plans available under the Bell Phone company. It also helps direct the customer to other departments. This bot being accessible 24/7 and handling lower-level requests greatly reduces labor costs.
